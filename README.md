# CPP Game Engine
The goal of this project is to make a basic 3D game engine using C++ which will allow you to create and play a rudimentary game level. The user should be able to draw upon a small collection of building blocks and object models as they please and add simple interactivity such as buttons as well as being able to enter a distinct 'play' mode in which the level becomes functional.
