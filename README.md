# CPP Game Engine
The goal of this project is to make a basic 3D game engine using C++ which will allow you to create and play a rudimentary game level. The user should be able to draw upon a small collection of building blocks and object models as they please and add simple interactivity such as buttons as well as being able to enter a distinct 'play' mode in which the level becomes functional.

Feature List:

     o 3D Rendering
         x ~~Hello Triangle!~~
         x ~~Simple Cube~~
         x ~~Transformation Matrices~~
         x ~~Fly Camera~~
         / Model Importing + Rendering
         - ?
     o User Interface
     o Design Mode
     o Play Mode
     o Save/Load System

Currently working on - Overhauling current code for drawing model geometry.
Next Step - Implementing textures for model rendering.

Libraries used:

     o GLAD [OpenGL] (Multi-Language Vulkan/GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL Loader-Generator)
     o GLFW (Graphics Library Framework)
     o GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
     o stb_image.h (STB Image Loader)
     o assimp (Open Asset Import Library)
